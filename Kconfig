config DEFAULT_CONFIG_FILE
	string "File with default settings"

	  SWUpdate may get its default configuration settings
	  from the specified file (if present). Users may
	  override the default configuration with the -f
	  option switch.

config SCRIPTS
	bool "enable pre and postinstall scripts"
	default y
	help
	  Enabling this option, the installer will run
	  pre- and postinstall scripts, if they are present
	  in the image. For security reason, this option
	  can be switched off.

config HW_COMPATIBILITY
	bool "check for hardware / software compatibility"
	default n
	help
	  If enabled, check if the hardware revision
	  supports the software version. Detecting the hardware
	  revision is very board specific, and it cannot be generalized.
	  For this reason, the software expects that the detected
	  version is written into a file by a previous software.

config HW_COMPATIBILITY_FILE
	string "File with detected hardware revisions"
	depends on HW_COMPATIBILITY
	default "/etc/hwrevision"
	help
	  File where to read the detected hardware revsion
	  that must be compared with the software version.
	  The file has simple entries (one per line) in the
	  format of "major.minor".

config SW_VERSIONS_FILE
	string "File with detected software version"
	default "/etc/sw-versions"
	help
	  This is an optional file that is scanned at the
	  beginning to read the installed versions of
	  all sw-components. Each entry in the file is a
	  a pair of "name version".
	  In sw-description,  an image can have the
	  optional attributes:
		"name" : key for searching in SW_VERSIONS_FILE
		"version" : version contained in the .swu
		"install-if-different" : if set, version
	  		is compared with the one in SW_VERSIONS_FILE.
	  The image is installed only if there is a version mismatch.
	  This lets reduce risks in case of components that are not
	  safe to be updated, such as the bootloader. Updating it is a risk,
	  but in some cases it can be required to do it. Having a check,
	  the risky-component is not always updated.

config CROSS_COMPILE
	string "Cross Compiler prefix"
	default ""
	help
	  If you want to build swupdate with a cross compiler, then you
	  will need to set this to the cross-compiler prefix, for example,
	  "i386-uclibc-".

	  Native builds leave this empty.

config SYSROOT
	string "Path to sysroot"
	default ""
	help
	  If you want to build swupdate with a cross compiler, then you
	  might also need to specify where /usr/include and /usr/lib
	  will be found.

	  For example, swupdate can be built against an installed
	  Android NDK, platform version 9, for ARM ABI with

	  CONFIG_SYSROOT=/opt/android-ndk/platforms/android-9/arch-arm

	  Native builds leave this empty.

config EXTRA_CFLAGS

menu 'Debugging Options'

config DEBUG
	bool "Build Swupdate with extra Debugging symbols"
	default n
	help
	  Say Y here if you wish to examine swupdate internals while applets are
	  running. This increases the size of the binary considerably, and
	  should only be used when doing development. If you are doing
	  development and want to debug swupdate, answer Y.

	  Most people should answer N.

config DEBUG_PESSIMIZE
	bool "Disable compiler optimizations"
	default n
	depends on DEBUG
	help
	  The compiler's optimization of source code can eliminate and reorder
	  code, resulting in an executable that's hard to understand when
	  stepping through it with a debugger. This switches it off, resulting
	  in a much bigger executable that more closely matches the source
	  code.

config WERROR
	bool "Abort compilation on any warning"
	default n
	help
	  Selecting this will add -Werror to gcc command line.

	  Most people should answer N.

config NOCLEANUP
	bool "Do not remove temporary files after execution"
	default n
	help
	  After each run, temporary files are removed from the directory
	  pointed to by the environment variable TMPDIR (/tmp as fallback
	  if unset) to restart in a clean state. For debugging purposes, it
	  helps to check the consistency of the files extracted by SWUpdate.
	  For production, answer N.

	bool "Disable cpio CRC verify if SHA 256 is enabled"
	depends on HASH_VERIFY
	default n
	help
	  Disable CRC check in cpio header if sha256 is enabled.
	  CRC in CPIO is not a real crc, but it is simply the sum
	  of all bytes belonging to a file as 32 bit value. It is
	  very weak and does not add any further safety if sha256
	  is activated. CPIO in Linux distros has also a bug and
	  CRC field is set to 0 when a file is larger as 2GB.

	  SWUpdate supports the newc cpio format if this is
	  selected. That format does not have a checksum.
